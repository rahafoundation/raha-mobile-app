 *
 * Additionally, we prefer the VERIFY_MEMBER operations on NEW_MEMBER activities to be
 * from the inviter, but they can have one from others.
 *
 * So, three scenarios: Corresponding NEW_MEMBER activity...
 * - doesn't have a VERIFY_MEMBER operation yet: Add this one to that NEW_MEMBER
 *   activity
 * - has a VERIFY_MEMBER operation corresponding to the new member's inviter: create
 *   this as an INDEPENDENT_OPERATION activity
 * - has a VERIFY_MEMBER operation, but this new one comes from the inviter: Replace
 *   the previous NEW_MEMBER activity with the old VERIFY_MEMBER operation as an
 *   INDEPENDENT_OPERATION activity, and add a new NEW_MEMBER activity
 *   replacing the previous VERIFY_MEMBER operation with this one from the inviter.
 *   - we don't need to worry about messing up timestamps, since a referral
 *     bonus mint activity also shouldn't exist yet (because this VERIFY_MEMBER
 *     operation comes from the inviter, which should precede the inviter
 *     minting a referral bonus) so the timestamp would already naturally be
